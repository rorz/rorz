I'm rorz, and I spend most of my time writing JavaScript (Node.js, React) and thinking about web UI / UX.

I'm currently working on [Verdn](https://verdn.com) — a tool for ecommerce stores to add environmental pledges to their products really easily.

If you also like JavaScript, and you're passionate about building things that help the environment, you should reach out to me:

`rory [at] verdn [dot] com`
